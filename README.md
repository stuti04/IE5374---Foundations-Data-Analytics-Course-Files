# IE5374-Foundations-Data-Analytics-Course-Files
This repository consists of mini projects implemented while taking the foundations course.

### Project Description

#### Project 1

This project was implemented as a part of the project series of my foundations of data analytics course at Northeastern University. Two types of clustering algorithms were implemented on the real-world and synthetic data - K-means and Hierachical. Finally, the results were evaluated using internal and external validation. 

#### Project 2

This project was implemented as a part of the project series of my foundations of data analytics course at Northeastern University. The objective of this project was to implement natural and horizontal visibility graph algorithms to extract time series features for human activity monitoring. After implementing the algorithms, metrics like average degree, network diameter, average path length, permutation entropy, and complexity were computed to understand which algorithm was performing better. Finally, scatter plots were generated to visualize the results. 

#### Project 3

This project was implemented as a part of the project series of my foundations of data analytics course at Northeastern University. As part of this project, I performed  keyword network analysis by extracting keyword data, computing the weighted adjacency matrix, and then converting it to a weighted network using Python. I also worked on Elon Musk's twitter data to generate word frequencies for each year in the dataset. Finally, the results of both the tasks were visualized in Python and R.
